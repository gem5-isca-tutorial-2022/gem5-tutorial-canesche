## Why develop gem5?

- Add new models
- Extend current models
- Fix things and contribute back!

### A bit about the difference between C++ and python

This is about gem5's structure.

### What is a SimObject?

- Main thing that gem5 uses as the bridge from the C++ models to the python configuration
- Things in `src/` and in the SimObjects should be the *model* not the configuration.

### gem5's event queue

- A bit about event-driven programming
- What it means for events to execute
- Relation between SimObjects and events

## Building gem5

- Dependencies
- Build system: [SCons](https://scons.org/)
- Build parameters
  - Two types: gem5 features and compiler parameters
  - Opt/fast, profiling, linker
  - ISA, GPU, Ruby protocol, others

## Making modifications and using git

- Install the hooks!
- Use the style checker! Don't ignore it!
- Create a branch for yourself
- Use good commit messages... it's worth the time!
